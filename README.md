# info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I use styled components and redux toolkit to manage the state and requests

tfjs lives within a hook, initially I planned on have a class for it and have it live in the userImage state and be used through thunk actions. but redux toolkit doesnt have proper use of asynk thunks outside of requests
